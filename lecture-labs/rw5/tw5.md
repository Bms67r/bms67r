## Thurday lab summary (09/19/19)

The purpose of today's lab was to demonstrate different kinds of testing on a computer application utilizing Pytesting. There are several
different kinds of Pytesting functions that can be utilized to error check a system. The only problems I ran into involve my own lack of experience
in the Python langauge. I am not familiar with the layout or capabilities of such a langauge, especially methods and functionality that 
the language includes, so I was not overly familiar with what some of the testing functions were doing or how they were doing what they were
doing. I feel this lab would have gone more smoothly if I were more famliar with the Python langauge.
