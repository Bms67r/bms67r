With this lab, we initialied postgreSQL with the tables and schemas needed for our purposes in class. In the end I managed to get everything installed sucessfully, but I received many problems resulting from some random, unforseable issue within the install files downloaded from the internet. Upon reinstalling completely, I was able to install the software correctly and set up the tables properly.
